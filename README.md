# vislib
Web app for creating your own collection of references to practice drawing from.

## Inspiration

[QuickPoses](https://quickposes.com/) is effectively what I am aiming at, but free, no signup, and providing tools to create a repo of images. There doesn't appear to be many web apps that allow for this within a few google/bing searches.

## Planned Features

1. Different practice modes (timed, iterative, free-form...)
3. Drag-and-drop images from other sites in the library
4. Support for albums
5. Annotating and creating sub-regions in an image (like focusing on a hand in a full-body pose) and deriving albums that way.
6. Exporting and backing up images
7. Mobile/Tablet responsiveness

### Nice to haves
1. Support a simple drawing interface to allow users to draw from mobile/tablet.
2. A "marketplace" for photos, like the other sites. At least a directory to other sites.
3. importing sketches and playing them back to see improvement over time.
4. Access to cloud services for storage
